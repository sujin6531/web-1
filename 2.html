    <h2>loving someone</h2>
My heart is telling me
the telly isn't telling me anything
I need but it needs to keep you selling me
Besides celebrities lacking in integrity
Holding up the status
quo instead of showing your kids
That they matter,
who're you gonna buy up next
Keep hold of their necks
and keep selling them sex
Itâ€™s better if we keep them
perplexed
It's better if we make them
want the opposite sex
And this drives
drunk through criminal minds
And you camp out beside
where your man resides
You're not slow,
it's just never been shown
That you should...
